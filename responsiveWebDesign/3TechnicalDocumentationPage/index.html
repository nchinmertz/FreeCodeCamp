                <p>Ingredients</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>605 grams AP or Bread Flour</li>
                    <li>66 grams Granulated Sugar</li>
                    <li>12 grams Kosher Salt</li>
                    <li>7 grams Active Dry Yeast</li>
                    <li>214 grams Water</li>
                    <li>120 grams Whole Milk</li>
                    <li>57 grams Unsalted Butter</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Create a well in the center, pour in water and milk. Mix on low speed until a tight, smooth dough comes together around the hook. Cover dough with a damp towel for 10 minutes</p>
                <p>Turn mixed on medium-low speed and add butter pieces all at once and continue to mix until dough has formed a very smooth, stretchy ball that is not sticky</p>
                <p>Form the dough into a ball and place seam-side down on a lightly-floured work surfect. Cut two deep perpendicular slashed in the dough. Place the dough slash-side up inside a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until 1.5 times it orginal size. Transfer the bowl to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours upto 12 hours.</p>

                    <li>340 grams Unsalted European Butter</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Place sticks of butter next to eah other in center of a large sheet of parchement paper.</p>
                <p>Loosely fold all four sides of the parchment over the butter to form a packet. Turn the packet over and use a rolling pin to lightly beat the cold butter into a flat 1/2 inche think layer.</p>
                <p>Unwrap the packet, and refold with neat, clean folds forming an <code>8 inch</code> square. Further flaten out the butter so that it fills the entire packet. The goal is a level-straight-edged square of butter. Transfer to refrigerator</p>

                <p>Uncover dough and transfer to clean work surface. Stretch the dough outward and flatten into a rough square, measuring ont more than <code>8 inch</code> on one side.</p>
                <p>Place dough atop 2 pieces of plastic wrap perpendiular to each onther, maintining squared off edges, roll pin over top like with the butter to form another <code>8 inch</code> square. Freeze 20 minutes</p>
                <p>Unwrap the dough and place on lightly floured surface, roll the dough until it is <code>16 inches</code> long while maintaining <code>8 inch</code> width.</p>
                <p>Unwrap the butter and using the parchment, place the butter in the center of the dough rectangle. Press the butter gently into the dough and peel off the parchment paper.</p>
                <p>Take the overhaning dough and bring it over the butter toward the center. Pinch the dough together along all seams so no butter peeks out.</p>
                <p>Rotate the dough 90 degrees so the seam is now vertical abd beat the dough lightly along the surface to lengthen and flatten.</p>
                <p>Roll the dough lengthwise along the seam into a <code>24 inch</code> long slab.</p> <code>Do not apply pressure downard while rolling, but rather push the dough away from you to ensure the layers</code>
                <p>Trim shorter ends removing excess dough and squaring off the corners.</p>
                <p>Take the short sides of the rectangle and bring them to the middle, leaving a small gap and aligning the sides. Now fold the entire slab in half along the gap in the center. Wrap in plastic. Freeze for 15 minutes then refrigerate for 1 hour</p>
                <p>Take dough out of refrigerator and let sit 5 minutes before beating the dough and rolling out into another <code>24 inch</code> rectangle</p>
                <p>Take one of the shorter sides of the rectangle and bring it a thrid of the way down. Bring the other side up and over. Wrap in platic wrap. Freeze for 15 minutes then refrigerate for 1 hour</p>
                <p>Take dough out of the refrigerator and beat and roll out into a <code>14 by 17 inch</code> rectangle. Wrap in platic wrap and freeze for 20 minutes, then chill 8 to 12 hours.</p>

                <code>Create the proofing environment</code>
                <p>Let the dough sit at room temperatire for 5 minutes and line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment.</p>
                <code>If necessary roll the dough into a 17 by 14 inch rectangle</code>
                <p>Trim off the any irregular edges on the shorter sides so the rectangle is now 16 inches long. Cut into 4 <code>4 by 14 inch</code> rectangles.</p>
                <p>Cut each rectangle by slicing a straight line from opposite corners of it to gorm two triangle. Trim each triangle at a slight angle forming isosceles triangles.</p>
                <p>With each triangle, grasp the corners at the base of the triangle and tug outward to widen the base about 3 inches. Then tug gently about halfway down the triangle to the point to length the triagnle and thin the dough as it narrows. Starting at the base, snuggle roll up the dough keeping the point centered and applying light pressure. Place cressent on prepared baking sheet, resting on the point.</p>
                <code>If the dough gets too soft while working, cover the triangle and freeze for a few minutes before rolling again.</code>

                <p>Create a proofing environment before shaping the crossiants. Bring a skillet of water to a simmer. Transfer to the floor of the ovena dn close the door.</p>
                <p>Lightly cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap so the coissants havs some room to expand.</p>
                <p>Place baking sheets inside proofing environment, it should be around 70-75 degrees. Allow to prood until croissants have doubled in size, are extremely puffy, and jiggle when the baking sheet is gently shaken, about 2 to 2.5 hours.</p>

                <p>In a small bowl combine egg yolk and heavy cream. Unsing a pastry brush, gently brush onto the smooth surfaces of each crescent. <code>Try to avaoid the cut sides so it does not prevent the crossiants from puffing up.</code></p>
                <p>Transfer the sheets to the ovena nd bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets and switch racks and continue to bake another 10 to 15 minutes util the crossiants are deeply browned.</p>
                <p>Remove from the ovena nd let cool completely on the baking sheets.</p>
